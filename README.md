design_patterns repository

Repository for practicing design patterns.

Languages in use may vary (C/C++, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, etc.) to keep up skills for each.

Although practice work might not be limited to a single design-pattern, the intent is to designate root directories for each design pattern and make self-contained modules of each containing all source code, tests, build scripts, etc.
